# The Video Game API CLI using Rich!

This small program uses the [Rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) Python library to make this a better looking CLI that makes it easier to read and use.

This not only uses the rich library to make a better looking CLI, it is also a partial rewrite of the existing project.

This now splits the functions into separate python files to make it easier to read and understand what's going on.

Enjoy!
